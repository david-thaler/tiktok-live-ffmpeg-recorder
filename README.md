# tiktok-live-ffmpeg-recorder
Tiktok live recorder using ffmpeg to automatically output recordings when a user goes live

This readme/documentation of project is TODO, for the time being the general gist is have a 
config folder ont the working directory with a config.json inside which matches the structure of 
AppConfig.java

This project is still under development and version 1.X will be considered a beta release which 
may change frequently. Only once I feel the code standard and stability of the project has been 
met will I promote this to version 2 which will be considered the actual release.
